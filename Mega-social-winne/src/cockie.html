        <h2><strong>What Are Cookies</strong></h2>

          are downloaded to your computer, to improve your experience. This page describes what information they gather,
          how we use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will also share how you can prevent these

        </p>

        <h2><strong>How We Use Cookies</strong></h2>

          standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to
          this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need them or not in
          case they are used to provide a service that you use.</p>

        <h2><strong>Disabling Cookies</strong></h2>

        <p>You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser Help for
          how to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other websites

        <h2><strong>The Cookies We Set</strong></h2>

        <ul>

          <li>
            <p>Surveys related cookies</p>
            <p>From time to time we offer user surveys and questionnaires to provide you with interesting insights,
              helpful tools, or to understand our user base more accurately. These surveys may use cookies to remember
              who has already taken part in a survey or to provide you with accurate results after you change pages.</p>
          </li>

        </ul>

        <h2><strong>Third Party Cookies</strong></h2>

        <p>In some special cases we also use cookies provided by trusted third parties. The following section details
          which third party cookies you might encounter through this site.</p>

        <ul>

          <li>
            <p>From time to time we test new features and make subtle changes to the way that the site is delivered.

        <p>Hopefully that has clarified things for you and as was previously mentioned if there is something that you
          aren't sure whether you need or not it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does interact with
          one of the features you use on our site.</p>
