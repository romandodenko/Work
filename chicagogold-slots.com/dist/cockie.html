        <h2><strong>How We Use Cookies</strong></h2>

        <h2><strong>Disabling Cookies</strong></h2>

        <p>You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser Help for

        <h2><strong>The Cookies We Set</strong></h2>

        <ul>
          <li>

            <p>This site offers newsletter or email subscription services and cookies may be used to remember if you are

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>As we sell products it's important for us to understand statistics about how many of the visitors to our
              site actually make a purchase and as such this is the kind of data that these cookies will track. This is
              important to you as it means that we can accurately make business predictions that allow us to monitor our
