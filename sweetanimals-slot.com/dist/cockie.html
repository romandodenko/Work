        are downloaded to your computer, to improve your experience. This page describes what information they gather,

      <h2><strong>How We Use Cookies</strong></h2>

        standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to
        this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need them or not in
        case they are used to provide a service that you use.</p>

      <h2><strong>Disabling Cookies</strong></h2>

      <p>You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser Help for

      <h2><strong>The Cookies We Set</strong></h2>

      <ul>

        <li>
          <p>Surveys related cookies</p>
          <p>From time to time we offer user surveys and questionnaires to provide you with interesting insights,
            helpful tools, or to understand our user base more accurately. These surveys may use cookies to remember
            who has already taken part in a survey or to provide you with accurate results after you change pages.</p>
        </li>

      </ul>

      <h2><strong>Third Party Cookies</strong></h2>

      <p>In some special cases we also use cookies provided by trusted third parties. The following section details
        which third party cookies you might encounter through this site.</p>

      <ul>

        <li>
          <p>As we sell products it's important for us to understand statistics about how many of the visitors to our
            site actually make a purchase and as such this is the kind of data that these cookies will track. This is
            important to you as it means that we can accurately make business predictions that allow us to monitor our
            advertising and product costs to ensure the best possible price.</p>
        </li>

      </ul>

      <h2><strong>More Information</strong></h2>

      <p>Hopefully that has clarified things for you and as was previously mentioned if there is something that you
        aren't sure whether you need or not it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does interact with
