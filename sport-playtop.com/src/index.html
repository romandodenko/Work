                Maximise your athletic performance, reduce your post-workout aches, and help prevent injuries with yoga.

                Professional athletes are making yoga a regular part of their fitness routines; and GQ, HuffPost, and
                Men's Health have all advocated yoga for men. Flexibility is one of the most important, yet overlooked,
                elements of fitness, and sports success- for example tight hamstrings mean your stride isn't as long
                when running, or that you can't swing your leg as high when kicking a ball.

                Yoga increases flexibility, building a bigger range of motion and allowing you to work more muscle
                fibres with every movement. With straightforward language and easy-to-follow steps, Man Yoga will teach
                you how to execute the 50 key yoga postures you need for greater endurance, flexibility, balance, and
                strength - no chanting required. It also includes 20 yoga workouts tailored to help you meet specific
                performance goals, such as core strength or greater power. You'll find that incorporating yoga into your
                training will help you get stronger, play harder, and feel better.
