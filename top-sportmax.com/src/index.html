                "Lyrical Soho" - this is how the name of the institution can be translated. An inexperienced reader will
                probably think that Soho is the name of the owner of the establishment. He will think and be mistaken,
                because Soho is the name of the "entertainment" district of London.
              </p>
              <p class="pubs__text text">
                It is located in the central part of the city and has a rather dubious reputation. After all, it houses
                casinos, gaming and all kinds of entertainment establishments.

                In the Lyrical Soho pub, you can not only drink beer atmospherically, but also yell at the top of your
                lungs during the broadcast of the English Premier League match. They adhere to neutrality here - the pub
                is not "imprisoned" for any particular club, and it looks completely different from a typical football
                one. However, a couple of glasses of real draft beer and a decent-sized telly can quickly correct this
                oversight.

                But this is a purely football pub. And the most that neither is football. After all, it was in The
                Freemasons Arms that the Football Association of England was founded in 1863. The most remarkable thing
                about this place is the basement. There, the owners made a museum in which they collected documents,
                memorable photos and other relics of a significant meeting for world football.

                The bar has undergone a reconstruction and, as it is now commonly called, a redesign of the interior. It
                retained its name, but began to look more modern, more stylish and fashionable. However, the spirit of
                football is still preserved. Which makes the pub popular among football fans. In the photo you can see
                the loading on the days of major matches. Impressive, huh? More people except in the Moscow metro.

                It is easy to guess who this pub is under. Under Arsenal, of course. So, if you are a fan of the Gunners, you are welcome. It is worth noting right away that exclusively fan pubs are located in areas with the largest concentration of fans of a particular club. They are usually located near stadiums. Nothing can be done - marketing and "business development".
              </p>
              <p class="pubs__text text">
                In The Gunners, you can admire the T-shirts of Arsenal legends, personal autographs of the Gunners' stars and other iconic paraphernalia. They say that Wenger himself drank here. Of course, it was not on the flood.
              </p>
              <p class="pubs__text text">
                One disadvantage of this pub is that you cannot watch the matches of other teams in it. Well, usually you can't. It seems that such establishments still broadcast the main football events, like the Champions League final or World Cup matches.

                In this case, it is already much more difficult to guess whose pub it is. Especially if you don't look at the photo. Let's not torture - this is a Tottenham fans' pub. And it is very different from the rest of the pubs in this top.

              <p class="pubs__text text">
                It cannot be called fashionable, it does not dazzle with colors and a juicy menu, it does not offer too wide a choice of beer "snacks". But on the other hand, it is definitely one of the most atmospheric pubs in all of London. Why?

              <p class="pubs__text text">
                And when did you see your favorite team's football game broadcast on an old laptop-sized TV? When did you see ashtrays cracked all the way to the bottom? And when was the woman pouring beer for the fans at the football pub? And here it is all there. As well as T-shirts on the walls, a pool table and intimate company for every game.

                Have you ever watched football at The Cow? A strange question, but our answer is also strange - be sure to look if you are in London. Very atmospheric place!

                The pub is located near the Olympic Park in Westfield. People usually come to this area to visit the large shopping center in Stratford. Needless to say, the founders of the institution chose a good place to open - tired of shopping, Londoners will come in for a sweet soul to drink beer or ale, which is highly praised here.
              </p>
              <p class="pubs__text text">
                The Caw hosts the official broadcasts of SkySports, which means that the entire English Premier League (as well as other English competitions) is at your service.
              </p>
              <p class="pubs__text text">
                The hall is decorated with caricatures and simple paintings of the “hostess” of the entire institution - a cow. They are treated, of course, with beef, wine, beer and ales. And great football, of course.
