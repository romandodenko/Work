                What is a lead generation banner?
              </div>
              <div class="faq__spoller-content">
                Rich media format banner with an online application form transfers the completed data directly to the
                advertiser's CRM system. The solution suggests not to lead the user back to the site or landing page,
                but to fill in the primary data on the current Internet portal where the advertisement is placed.

                What is a dynamic banner?
              </div>
              <div class="faq__spoller-content">
                A banner is a kind of template - a constructor, which is formed in real time from the information
                provided in the XML catalog. The solution guarantees the individualization of advertising, in which each
                of your visitors will see individual content corresponding to his interest.

                If the user wants to unsubscribe from advertising, he just needs to follow the link through the I icon
                in the upper right corner of the banner and follow the instructions on the page with the opt-out
                function.
