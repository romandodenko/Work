            that are downloaded to your computer, to improve your experience. This page describes what information they
            gather, how we use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will also share how you can
            prevent these cookies from being stored however this may downgrade or 'break' certain elements of the sites
            functionality.</p>

          <h2 class="subtitle" data-aos="zoom-out-up"><strong>How We Use Cookies</strong></h2>

          <p class="text" data-aos="zoom-out-up">We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately in most cases there are no industry
            standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add

            features of the this site. Therefore it is recommended that you do not disable cookies.</p>

          <h2 class="subtitle" data-aos="zoom-out-up"><strong>The Cookies We Set</strong></h2>

          <ul data-aos="zoom-out-up">

            <li>
              <p>Account related cookies</p>
              <p>If you create an account with us then we will use cookies for the management of the signup process and
                general administration. These cookies will usually be deleted when you log out however in some cases
                they may remain afterwards to remember your site preferences when logged out.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Login related cookies</p>
              <p>We use cookies when you are logged in so that we can remember this fact. This prevents you from having
                to log in every single time you visit a new page. These cookies are typically removed or cleared when
                you log out to ensure that you can only access restricted features and areas when logged in.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="subtitle" data-aos="zoom-out-up"><strong>Third Party Cookies</strong></h2>
