            The story of how a man, usually against his will, turns into a wolf was a persistent myth that is still strong today. That's why there are still so many werewolf slots out there, and Pragmatic wisely decided to take a rather original approach with their Curse of the Werewolf Megaways release. The title may seem serious, but the visuals and soundtrack soon show that it's more of a horror/comedy with neatly drawn caricature characters in a cartoon style.
