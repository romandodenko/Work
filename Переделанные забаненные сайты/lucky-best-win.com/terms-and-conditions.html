  <p><strong>General Provisions</strong></p>
  <p>1.1. The Terms of Service define the rules for the use by individual users (hereinafter referred to as the

  with access to the service comprising a game platform operated for entertainment purposes, as well as to allow
  Users to get in touch and share information and opinions with other persons interested in games, and to improve

  <p>1.3. As part of the services offered by the Service Provider, Members may participate in games in which scoring
  depends on their speed of reaction, dexterity and perceptive skills. To become the winner, a player must score the
  most points in a relevant play which requires the application of the above mentioned skills, or in games in which
  scoring or the final result depends, to a certain degree or solely, on chance.</p>
  <p>1.4. Using the services made available via the Service and applying for Service membership shall be tantamount to
  acknowledging and accepting the terms and conditions set forth herein and to being bound by such terms and

    <p>2.3 The Service Provider wishes to advise the Service Users that, since the outcome of a number of plays in games
    made available via the Service depends on the speed of reaction, dexterity and perceptive skills of players,
    persons suffering from certain kinds of disabilities, especially vision impairment or motor disability, may find
    it difficult to use the Service. The Service Provider informs that, given the current level of IT technology
    advancement, it has no means of ensuring special access to the Service for the disabled persons. Concurrently, the
    Service Provider wishes to assure the Service Users that, as soon as technologically feasible, it will provide
    such persons with access to plays available via the Service.</p>
    <p>2.4 If a User registering for Service membership expresses such wish, he/she shall obtain access to the services
    offered by the Service Provider immediately upon registration. In such a case, the User has no right to withdraw
    from the agreement in accordance with the Act on Protection of Certain Consumer Rights. In each case, a User shall

    plays in a play provided via the Service.</p>
    <p>2.5 When registering for Service membership, Users shall complete a registration form, where they enter accurate
    and up-to-date details. If Users provide information regarding their payment/credit cards, they are obliged to
    make certain that they are fully entitled to use such cards and possess sufficient funds to pay all fees due to
    the Service Provider.</p>
    <p>2.6 If the information provided by a Member upon registration is found to be misleading, incomplete or

    <p></p>
    <p><strong>RULES FOR RESPONSIBLE GAMING</strong></p>
    <p>The purpose of the internet Service is to provide its users with entertainment, enable them to get involved in
    contacts and discussion with other users sharing the same interests, and upgrade their knowledge on the issues of
    poker and gaming. Making the Service available to the public we hope, that all its users will use the services
    provided in the Service for that purpose. It can happen however that using services provided in the Service,
    instead of its being the source of entertainment, will become for some users the way of spending excessive amounts
    of time and money. Such cases are rare and above all possible to avoid, if only the following basic rules are
    observed:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>I play for fun.</li>
    <li>I play for ranking points of no real value, I’m aware the only value of them is my satisfaction.</li>
    <li>I spend for playing only as much money as I can afford to lose.</li>
    <li>I try to win, but I never try to take revenge.</li>
    <li>I do not play when I am sad, tired and/or discouraged, under the effects of drugs or alcohol.</li>
    <li>I can spend my free time also doing things other than playing games.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Remember, when you feel that playing games becomes for you something more then only the source of entertainment,
    you may, according to the Service Rules demand for your Member Account to be removed, and your access to the
    services provided in the Service to be permanently denied.</p>
