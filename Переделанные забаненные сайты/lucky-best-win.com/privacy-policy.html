    <p><strong>PROFILING</strong></p>
    <p>Profiling is defined as “any form of automatic processing of personal data that consists of using personal data
      to evaluate certain personal data regarding the person’s work, economic situation, health, personal preferences,
      interests, trustworthiness, behaviour, geographical position or movements.” We use automatic decisions, hereunder
      profiling to define target groups based on geographical locations and interests. The profiling is taking place
      based on you having expressed interest for gambling by visiting this website. Hereafter you can expect to be
      presented for banners on other websites, just as you may be presented for adverts on Facebook and other social
      media channels we use to reach our target audience(s). Furthermore it will be registered wherefrom you access this
      website, and the geographical location may influence how we create campaigns. We will target campaigns to specific
      geographic locations in the event we based on accumulative profiling data can conclude that there is a big
      interest for our marketing in specific cities/areas.</p>
    <p><strong>WHERE YOUR PERSONAL DATA STEMS FROM</strong></p>
    <p>It is registered when you interact with us either by visiting this website directly or indirectly. This could be

      Commission has made a decision on the level of security of personal data and in this it appears that the level of
      security in the U.S. is not sufficient. However, the EU Commission has determined that organizations based in the
      U.S. are ’safe areas’, if they have joined the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield agreement. The EU Commission considers New
      Zealand a safe third country. We transfer data to following U.S.-based organizations that are part of the Privacy
      Shield agreement:</p>
